About BITBOT
--------

You control a Bot-in-training Bot with a limited energy supply who is stuck in a
loop of sensing, planning, and acting - when you sense, you can’t act.  To act
you must first plan, and by the time you act, your senses may have been
outdated.  You must make it from the start to the goal while balancing your
energy supply, and anticipating how the world might be when you begin to act.

Use the arrow keys to control your robot in planning mode, and be aware that
when you execute, the world might look different!
